## Project Overview

### General Description

`FIX6DSENSE.AI` is an AI-Powered real-time virtual assistant that enables the visually impaired to see the world by hearing.

### Features

- Priority-based detection
- Distance prediction & scaling algorithm
- Mobile phone activated camera for various items
- Speech-activated mode selection
- Multi-threading usage for asynchronous voice warnings and feedbacks
- SSD Mobilenet COCO API Model

## How To Run

1. Clone this repository and make sure you have all the files downloaded

2. Set your environment and install the required python packages

    It is recommended for you to use Anaconda, and specifically `python version 3.9.0` (newer version of python has some compatibility issues related to the `collections` package, other older python version is untested and might have some compatibility issues as well). Then, install all the required python packages by typing:

    ```powershell
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Execute `main.py` or `main.ipynb` file

    If you want to use an external camera, you can connect via IP Webcam Pro and edit the `url` variable when running the model. By default, it is connected to your PC / Laptop default camera. You can also toggle the `USE_SPEECH` global variable to `True` or `False`. If it is `True`, it will use speech recognition to choose and change the mode, or else it will manually prompt you for the mode input.
